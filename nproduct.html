                <p>There have been countless dreams about enterting a video game or a book, truly living in their world, and now we are one step closer. We do not look at the present, we only look forwards, and we will not hesitate to dive into the future!
The Delusional Instant Vold Elimination Register (DIVER) is the second of three revolutionary keyboards we have created, and it's main use is to enhance the experience of any user with its lightning-fast input speeds. The DIVER works through directly connecting your brain with the keyboard, catching brain signals of specific frequencies and converting them into electrical signals that the keyboard then reads and executes whatever command is linked to it. This completely eliminates all of the small nuisances that exists in global computer use, from gaming to creating, writing to browsing... Closing a tab, throwing out a spell, undoing a mistake, typing a word... They can all be done with a single thought in an instant. This ups your efficiency by several times and is invaluable for anyone who cares about speed.</p>

            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <div> The DIVER is unlike usual keyboards in that it's not mainly used for typing, it is like an invisible remote to your computer with infinite adaptability. It is very easy to use and doesn't require any setup, anyone can just put the receptors on and start diving, but the horizons truly open up when you become an advanced user. Those familiar with the keyboard will be able to produce entire videos without even touching the keyboard using the multitude of shortcuts available, or even play through games with just your head. Your workflow and gameflow will remain constant and uninterrupted without any of the previous hassles of, for example, having to move your mouse to open up your browser when you need to search for something. Diving will give you an edge in everything you do on your computer, and is a must-have for anyone that want to optimize their play.

        <div class="FEUM" id="FEUM">
            <h3>Connection</h3>
            <div> The DIVER uses a custom ion wire within a copper cord to catch the subtle signals from the brain while still allowing a natural flow within the body, it is used by placing the two receptors on both sides of your neck. They're flexible, light and incredibly thin, so when placed you won't notice that they're there, and when removed from human skin they will simply retract into the keyboard.
            Your safety is a prime concern, so we have gotten professional opinions from several top medical institutes to review our product and confirm its safety, so do not worry.  </div>
