                <h2>The ARK</h2>
                <p>The ARK is, as named, specialized in remote access and automated typing. For tens of years, many dreamed about a keyboard like it, but due to technological restrictions it was not possible... However. With the release of the Peer Pressure Pistons (Patent Pending) tech such restrictions have been lifted. The use of this tech is yet unexplored carrying infinite potential, and our product promises nothing less, something completely unseen in modern society.</p>

            <h3>PPP keys</h3>
            <div> The new breakthrough in Keyboard tech, mechanical switches are enhanced with metal hooks, softening the keystroke to reduce stress on the keys to increase key stroke life span by up to 90 million strokes. That's not all, the highly adaptable hooks enable never-before-seen control of the individual keys of the entire keyboard. This can reduce noise, increase or decrease actuation force and even lock keys in place if they should be unable to be accessed or hidden within the keyboard (Perfect for travelling).  </div>

            <h3>FEU system</h3>
            <div> A system tailor-made for the PPP keys, this application controls all functionalities you might want on a PPP keyboard. Some of the many possibilities include freely locking keys in standing or lying position, changing the actuation force of any individual key to your liking or even completely switch the keys from tactile switches to linear. However, the FEU system is not limited to just modify your keyboard, due to the PPP tech it can also actively control the keyboard.  </div>
